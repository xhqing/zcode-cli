# Releasing zcode-cli

This document covers the maintainer-only workflows for synchronizing the
upstream runtime, building the npm tarball, and publishing releases. End users
do not need any of this — see the [main README](../README.md) for installation
and usage. The npm package is distributed as `zcode-app-cli`; `zcode-cli` is
the project / command display name.

## Remote extraction

The same path used by CI can be run locally:

```bash
brew install sevenzip
bun run sync -- --platform linux --arch x64
```

Use the committed artifact instead of the latest updater manifest when
rebuilding a reviewed release:

```bash
bun run sync:locked
```

The synchronization command:

1. reads the public stable-channel manifest used by ZCode Desktop, with the
   static CDN manifest as a fallback only when the service response is
   unavailable or invalid;
2. downloads the matching installer;
3. verifies its SHA-512 from the manifest;
4. extracts `resources/glm`;
5. builds and injects the local `@zcode/tui` adapter;
6. validates the official CLI version;
7. records provenance in `vendor/extraction.json`;
8. records the remote artifact URL and SHA-512 in
   `zcode-runtime.lock.json`;
9. aligns the npm version prefix with the ZCode App version while preserving
   the independently incremented CLI build revision.

## npm package contents

The published package is controlled by the `files` allowlist in `package.json`.
It contains only:

- `bin/zcode.js`, the bundled executable Node.js launcher;
- `vendor/`, the verified official `zcode.cjs` runtime, official bundled
  plugins and the compiled local `@zcode/tui` adapter;
- `config.example.json` and `zcode-runtime.lock.json`;
- `README.md`, `LICENSE` and the required npm `package.json`.

Tests, GitHub workflows, build scripts, launcher/TUI TypeScript sources, local
config, `.release/` artifacts and development `node_modules` are not published.
npm installs only the declared pi-tui runtime dependency. The launcher and TUI
are compiled to JavaScript with `tsdown`; its launcher banner adds the Node.js
shebang directly, with no post-build rewrite. The compiled TUI is injected into
`vendor/` before publication.

## Versioning

Package versions use `<app-version>-<build>`, for example `3.3.5-2`. The prefix
tracks the upstream ZCode App. The globally increasing build revision tracks
fixes and features in this project. Do not use `3.3.5+build.2`: SemVer ignores
`+build` metadata when comparing upgrades.

Increment the project revision before publishing a local fix or feature:

```bash
bun run version:build
```

The release workflows normally perform that increment for you. The command is
also available for local inspection and exceptional manual preparation.

## Release flow

Publishing is split into two workflows so the committed version, npm package,
Git tag and GitHub Release all describe the same release:

1. `.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml` extracts and validates the current
   official runtime, then opens or updates a Release PR containing the exact
   `package.json` version and `zcode-runtime.lock.json` build input;
2. a maintainer reviews and merges that PR;
3. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` checks out its merge commit, rebuilds the
   exact locked runtime, audits and install-tests the tarball, publishes through
   npm Trusted Publishing, then creates `v<version>` and the corresponding
   GitHub Release.

The generated `vendor/` directory remains ignored by Git and is rebuilt in both
workflows. Its updater URL and SHA-512 are committed in
`zcode-runtime.lock.json`. Preparation resolves the latest manifest; publishing
downloads the committed URL and verifies the locked SHA-512, so a later upstream
update cannot silently change a reviewed release.

The scheduled workflow follows the Desktop stable channel (`channel=1`) without
credentials or a personal `device_mid`. Static `latest-*.yml` files can lag the
service and are therefore recovery inputs, not the primary update signal. If
upstream rolls its stable channel back, synchronization keeps a newer committed
lock instead of silently downgrading it; adopting a rollback requires an
explicit maintainer review of `zcode-runtime.lock.json`.

The preparation workflow checks upstream once per day at 01:30 in the
`Asia/Shanghai` timezone, in `upstream` mode. [GitHub documents scheduled
triggers as best effort](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule):
under high Actions load a scheduled event can still be delayed or dropped. The
preparation itself is idempotent:
the fixed release branch is created or updated only when the runtime lock or
package version changes. A same-version upstream repack increments the global
build so npm still receives an immutable new version. From the Actions page,
run **Prepare ZCode CLI release** with one of these modes:

- `cli` increments the global build and also aligns with the latest App;
- `upstream` checks for an App update without incrementing the build.

The modes use `release/zcode-cli` and `release/zcode-upstream` respectively. If
both PRs are open, merge one and rerun the other preparation mode so its version
is recalculated from the new `main` branch.

The workflow also runs a least-privilege keepalive job on scheduled events. It
calls [GitHub's workflow-enable API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows#enable-a-workflow)
instead of creating dummy commits, which prevents the public-repository 60-day
inactivity rule from disabling this schedule. This cannot eliminate
platform-wide outages or dropped events; for a hard delivery deadline, use an
external scheduler or run the workflow manually:

```bash
gh workflow run prepare-release.yml --ref main -f kind=upstream
gh workflow enable prepare-release.yml
```

Merging either Release PR publishes automatically. **Publish ZCode CLI
release** can also be started manually for recovery. Its `publish` checkbox can
be disabled to run all validation and consistency checks without changing npm,
Git tags or GitHub Releases. Publication, tag creation and GitHub Release
creation are independently idempotent, so a partially completed run can be
retried safely.

## Local release build

Local packaging uses the same commands as the publishing workflow. Start from
the exact clean commit whose version will be published:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run release:build
git diff --exit-code -- package.json zcode-runtime.lock.json
bun run release:pack
```

`release:build` runs TypeScript checking and all tests, downloads the artifact
from `zcode-runtime.lock.json`, verifies its SHA-512, builds and injects the TUI,
then runs runtime and PTY smoke tests. `release:pack` runs the offline
`prepack` guard, creates `.release/zcode-cli-<version>.tgz` (the `npm pack`
output `zcode-app-cli-<version>.tgz` is renamed after the project), audits every
included path and executable mode, installs it into a temporary directory, and
runs the installed `zcode --version`. Its final size, integrity and file count
are written to `.release/release.json`.

Inspect that manifest and then publish explicitly:

```bash
npm login
npm publish --access public --tag latest --provenance=false
```

The final `npm publish` intentionally remains explicit to avoid an accidental
registry mutation. It reruns the same offline `prepack` guard and fails if the
compiled TUI, runtime provenance, lock file, launcher permissions or package
allowlist are stale. `--provenance=false` applies only to this local bootstrap
path; GitHub OIDC generates provenance automatically.

Publish from the repository root as shown, rather than passing the `.tgz` to
`npm publish`: directory publication lets npm record the current Git `gitHead`,
which the recovery workflow later verifies. The tarball is the audited preview
and install-test artifact.

## Initial npm setup

If the package does not exist on npm yet, bootstrap it once from the exact
committed `main` revision using the local release build above. If its Git diff
check fails, do not publish from that working tree; refresh the Release PR or
restore the committed version and lock first.

Synchronization preserves the build when the upstream App version changes. For
example, syncing `3.3.5-12` against ZCode App `3.4.0` produces `3.4.0-12`.

Before enabling publication:

1. confirm that `zcode-app-cli` is the npm package name you control;
2. confirm redistribution rights for the extracted ZCode runtime;
3. under the GitHub repository's **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**,
   enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**;
4. open the package on npmjs.com and select **Settings** →
   **Trusted Publisher** → **GitHub Actions**;
5. enter the GitHub organization or user, repository, and workflow filename
   `publish.yml`; leave the environment name empty because this
   workflow does not use a GitHub Environment, and select `npm publish` under
   **Allowed actions**;
6. save the publisher, prepare a `cli` release, and merge its Release PR to
   verify an OIDC publication.

The publisher runs on a GitHub-hosted runner with Node 24, grants
`id-token: write`, and updates npm to the current release. It never reads an
`NPM_TOKEN` repository secret; npm attaches provenance from the OIDC identity.
After verifying the first OIDC release, npm recommends setting **Publishing
access** to require 2FA and disallow tokens, then revoking any obsolete
automation token.

The publisher skips an identical existing version, refuses older versions,
verifies every existing npm release's `gitHead`, and refuses to reuse a tag
that points at another commit. The `latest` dist-tag therefore advances only
to the newest validated App-plus-build release.
